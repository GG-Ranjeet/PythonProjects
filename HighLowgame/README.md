## ðŸ“± High-Low: Instagram Followers Edition

A fun console game where you guess who has more Instagram followers between two famous people.

### ðŸŽ® How to Play

- Two famous personalities are shown.
- You are given:
  - The **name**
  - A short **description** (like "actor", "singer", "athlete", etc.)
  - **Follower count of the first person**
- You must guess whether the **second person** has **more** or **fewer** followers.
  - Type `h` for **higher**
  - Type `l` for **lower**
- If you're right, you score a point and continue to the next round.
- If you're wrong, the game ends.

### ðŸ§  What I Practiced

- Using Python dictionaries and lists
- Creating a clean game loop
- Comparing numerical data
- Random selection and formatting output
- Creating a better user experience in the terminal

### ðŸ’¡ Possible Future Features

- Add categories (actors only, sports only, etc.)
- Use real-time data from APIs (e.g., Instagram or other platforms)
- Add GUI using `Tkinter` or `PyGame`
- Leaderboard or high score saving
